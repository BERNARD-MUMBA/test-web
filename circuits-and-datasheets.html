  <p>
ealier we produced 250W per channel amplifier pcb which had 2channels and can go up to 100W Music power. This pcb was a high quality high efficient
amplifieer. Its output stage have common emitter configuration both on positive and negative side and its efficient 
was above 80% due to that its output configuration was amplifying  both current and voltage. See te pictur bellow.

  Yet again a mono 200W pcb is out which you can order from <a href="mailto: maximbernardmumba@gmail.com"><e>MAXIM</e></e></a>. This is also a high power
  amplier which is in two varieties the firs type is having a dalington pair and a feedback pair on its output output stage. This amplifier is capable of handling
  up to 400W music power.

  The second ty has a dalingtone pushpull setup at its output formed by TIP41,TIP42, A1106 and C2581. This makes it hundle high current and biger speaker.
  Both pcbs are high power ampliffiers working at same voltages and currents and you can conect them to up to 30V-0-30V and use C5200 and or A1943. The change which is there
  now is that <e>MAXIM</e> circuit boards will now be coming with footprints showing the part number or value of individual components used. This means that, now w2e shall no 
  longer be adding circuit diagrams on pcbs as we supply. You can now get circuit diagram on our official webpage or here.
  Model numbers of this pcbs shall be given and use the to get desired circuits.
